# NJIT Academic Calendar Converter
This is an academic calendar converter that can be added to your Google Calendar. I used the academic calendar from the "Academic Calendars" tab of the Office of the Registrar's page on NJIT's website, the link can be found here: https://www.njit.edu/registrar/calendars. To look at other academic calendars besides the one for the upcoming semester, you can use the link provided and scroll down to the bottom.
