# NJIT Academic Calendar Converter
This is an academic calendar converter that can be added to your Google Calendar. I used the academic calendar from the "Academic Calendars" tab of the Office of the Registrar's page on NJIT's website, the link can be found here: https://www.njit.edu/registrar/calendars. To look at other academic calendars besides the one for the upcoming semester, you can use the link provided and scroll down to the bottom.

## :question: How do I use this?
The simpliest way to use this would be to download the .csv file from the documents above corresponding to which calendar you want, open your Google Calendar, click on the plus sign next to "Other calendars" on the left side, click "Import", select the downloaded .csv file to add to your calendar, and then click on "Import."
